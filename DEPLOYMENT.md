# PDF Editor Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the PDF Editor application in a GitHub Codespaces environment, along with an overview of the system architecture and implemented features.

## System Overview

The PDF Editor is a web application built with Flask that allows users to:
1. Upload PDF documents
2. Convert PDFs to HTML with exact 1:1 formatting preservation
3. Edit the content while maintaining all text attributes and formatting
4. Save the edited content back to PDF format

The application follows NASA's safety-critical coding guidelines, including small, simple functions, bounded loops, minimal variable scopes, rigorous input validation, and comprehensive error handling.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with Codespaces access
- Python 3.8+ knowledge
- Basic understanding of Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Setup GitHub Codespaces

1. Create a new GitHub repository for the PDF Editor project.
2. Push all project files to the repository.
3. Click the "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".
4. Create a new Codespace.

### 2. Environment Setup

Once the Codespace is running, open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install flask werkzeug

# Set environment variables
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
export SECRET_KEY=your_secure_secret_key  # Replace with a secure random key in production
```

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# Create the uploads directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p uploads

# Run the Flask application
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080
```

The application will be accessible at the Codespaces URL provided by GitHub, which typically follows this pattern:
`https://username-repositoryname-uniqueid.github.dev`

### 4. Production Deployment Considerations

For production deployment, consider the following:

1. Set a strong `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
2. Configure proper SSL/TLS
3. Use a production-grade WSGI server like Gunicorn
4. Set `FLASK_ENV=production`
5. Implement proper user authentication
6. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
7. Configure proper logging

Example production setup:

```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install gunicorn

# Run with Gunicorn
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:8080 app:app
```

## PDF-to-HTML Conversion Details

The current implementation provides placeholders for the PDF-to-HTML conversion functionality. To implement the actual conversion in a production environment, you would need to:

1. Integrate with a PDF processing library such as pdf.js, pdf2htmlEX, or a commercial PDF API
2. Implement the actual conversion logic in the `/convert-pdf` endpoint
3. Ensure all text attributes are preserved during conversion
4. Implement the HTML-to-PDF conversion for saving edited content

## Security Considerations

The application implements several security best practices:

1. Input validation for all file uploads and form submissions
2. Content type verification for uploaded files
3. File size limitations (16MB max)
4. Secure filename handling with `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename`
5. CSRF protection through proper form handling
6. Error logging for debugging and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

Consider the following enhancements for future versions:

1. User authentication system
2. Cloud storage integration for PDFs
3. Advanced text formatting options
4. Collaboration features
5. Version history and change tracking
6. Image handling within PDFs
7. Form field support
8. Mobile optimization

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **File upload errors**: Ensure the `uploads` directory exists and has proper permissions
2. **CORS issues**: If integrating with external services, proper CORS headers may be needed
3. **Memory issues**: For large PDFs, server memory limits might need adjusting
4. **Session issues**: Check that Flask's secret key is properly configured
