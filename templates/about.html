                <p class="lead">We're dedicated to providing the most accurate PDF editing experience on the web.</p>
                <p>PDF Editor was created to solve a common problem: the need to make small changes to PDF documents without losing any formatting. Traditional PDF editors either limit your editing capabilities or don't preserve the exact formatting when making changes. Our platform changes that by offering pixel-perfect editing with immediate visual feedback.</p>

                <h2 class="h3 mb-3">How Our Technology Works</h2>
                <p>Our advanced PDF-to-HTML conversion engine carefully analyzes your document to create an exact HTML replica that preserves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Text Styling:</strong> We maintain bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and other text decorations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Font Properties:</strong> All font families, weights, styles, and sizes are preserved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Layout & Spacing:</strong> Text alignment, line height, letter spacing, and other layout aspects remain intact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advanced Formatting:</strong> Subscript, superscript, text justification, and hyphenation are all maintained.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you've made your edits, our platform regenerates the PDF with the exact same formatting, ensuring your document looks professional and consistent.</p>
